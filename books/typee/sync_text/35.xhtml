      <span id="f03346">Appendix</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f03347">The author of this volume arrived at Tahiti the very day that the iniquitous designs of the French were consummated by inducing the subordinate chiefs, during the absence of their queen, to ratify an artfully-drawn treaty, by which she was virtually deposed. </span>
      <span id="f03348">Both menaces and caresses were employed on this occasion, and the 32-pounders which peeped out of the port-holes of the frigate were the principal arguments adduced to quiet the scruples of the more conscientious islanders.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f03349">And yet this piratical seizure of Tahiti, with all the woe and desolation which resulted from it, created not half so great a sensation, at least in America, as was caused by the proceedings of the English at the Sandwich Islands. </span>
      <span id="f03350">No transaction has ever been more grossly misrepresented than the events which occurred upon the arrival of Lord George Paulet at Oahu. </span>
      <span id="f03351">During a residence of four months at Honolulu, the metropolis of the group, the author was in the confidence of an Englishman who was much employed by his lordship; and great was the author&#39;s astonishment on his arrival at Boston, in the autumn of 1844, to read the distorted accounts and fabrications which had produced in the United States so violent an outbreak of indignation against the English. </span>
      <span id="f03352">He deems it, therefore, a mere act of justice towards a gallant officer briefly to state the leading circumstances connected with the event in question.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f03353">It is needless to rehearse all the abuse that for some time previous to the spring of 1843 had been heaped upon the British residents, especially upon Captain Charlton, Her Britannic Majesty&#39;s consul-general, by the native authorities of the Sandwich Islands. </span>
      <span id="f03354">High in the favour of the imbecile king at this time was one Dr. </span>
      <span id="f03355">Judd, a sanctimonious apothecary-adventurer, who, with other kindred and influential spirits, were animated by an inveterate dislike to England. </span>
      <span id="f03356">The ascendancy of a junta of ignorant and designing Methodist elders in the councils of a half-civilised king, ruling with absolute sway over a nation just poised between barbarism and civilisation, and exposed by the peculiarities of its relations with foreign states to unusual difficulties, was not precisely calculated to impart a healthy tone to the policy of the government.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f03357">At last matters were brought to such an extremity, through the iniquitous maladministration of affairs, that the endurance of further insults and injuries on the part of the British consul was no longer to be borne. </span>
      <span id="f03358">Captain Charlton, insultingly forbidden to leave the islands, clandestinely withdrew, and arriving at Valparaiso, conferred with Rear-Admiral Thomas, the English commander-in-chief on the Pacific station. </span>
      <span id="f03359">In consequence of this communication, Lord George Paulet was despatched by the admiral in the Carysfort frigate, to inquire into and correct the alleged abuses. </span>
      <span id="f03360">On arriving at his destination, he sent his first lieutenant ashore with a letter to the king, couched in terms of the utmost courtesy, and soliciting the honour of an audience. </span>
      <span id="f03361">The messenger was denied access to His Majesty, and Paulet was coolly referred to Dr. </span>
      <span id="f03362">Judd, and informed that the apothecary was invested with plenary powers to treat with him. </span>
      <span id="f03363">Rejecting this insolent proposition, his lordship again addressed the king by letter, and renewed his previous request; but he encountered another repulse. </span>
      <span id="f03364">Justly indignant at this treatment, he penned a third epistle, enumerating the grievances to be redressed, and demanding a compliance with his requisitions, under penalty of immediate hostilities.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f03365">The government was now obliged to act, and an artful stroke of policy was decided upon by the despicable councillors of the king to entrap the sympathies and rouse the indignation of Christendom. </span>
      <span id="f03366">His Majesty was made to intimate to the British captain that he could not, as the conscientious ruler of his beloved people, comply with the arbitrary demands of his lordship, and in deprecation of the horrors of war, tendered to his acceptance the provisional cession of the islands, subject to the result of the negotiations then pending in London. </span>
      <span id="f03367">Paulet, a bluff and straight-forward sailor, took the king at his word, and after some preliminary arrangements, entered upon the administration of Hawaiian affairs, in the same firm and benignant spirit which marked the discipline of his frigate, and which had rendered him the idol of his ship&#39;s company. </span>
      <span id="f03368">He soon endeared himself to nearly all orders of the islanders; but the king and the chiefs, whose feudal sway over the common people was laboriously sought to be perpetuated by their missionary advisers, regarded all his proceedings with the most vigilant animosity. </span>
      <span id="f03369">Jealous of his growing popularity, and unable to counteract it, they endeavoured to assail his reputation abroad by ostentatiously protesting against his acts, and appealing in Oriental phrase to the wide universe to witness and compassionate their unparalleled wrongs.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f03370">Heedless of their idle clamours, Lord George Paulet addressed himself to the task of reconciling the differences among the foreign residents, remedying their grievances, promoting their mercantile interests, and ameliorating, as far as lay in his power, the condition of the degraded natives. </span>
      <span id="f03371">The iniquities he brought to light and instantly suppressed are too numerous to be here recorded; but one instance may be mentioned that will give some idea of the lamentable misrule to which these poor islanders are subjected.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f03372">It is well known that the laws at the Sandwich Islands are subject to the most capricious alterations, which, by confounding all ideas of right and wrong in the minds of the natives, produce the most pernicious effects. </span>
      <span id="f03373">In no case is this mischief more plainly descernible than in the continually shifting regulations concerning licentiousness. </span>
      <span id="f03374">At one time the most innocent freedoms between the sexes are punished with fine and imprisonment; at another the revocation of the statute is followed by the most open and undisguised profligacy.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f03375">It so happened that at the period of Paulet&#39;s arrival the Connecticut blue laws had been for at least three weeks steadily enforced. </span>
      <span id="f03376">In consequence of this, the fort at Honolulu was filled with a great number of young girls, who were confined there doing penance for their slips from virtue. </span>
      <span id="f03377">Paulet, although at first unwilling to interfere with regulations having reference solely to the natives themselves, was eventually, by the prevalence of certain reports, induced to institute a strict inquiry into the internal administration of General Kekuanoa, governor of the island of Oahu, one of the pillars of the Hawaiian Church, and captain of the fort. </span>
      <span id="f03378">He soon ascertained that numbers of the young females employed during the day at work intended for the benefit of the king, were at night smuggled over the ramparts of the fort - which on one side directly overhangs the sea - and were conveyed by stealth on board such vessels as had contracted with the General to be supplied with them. </span>
      <span id="f03379">Before daybreak they returned to their quarters, and their own silence with regard to these secret excursions was purchased by a small portion of those wages of iniquity which were placed in the hands of Kekuanoa.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f03380">The vigour with which the laws concerning licentiousness were at that period enforced, enabled the General to monopolise in a great measure the detestable trade in which he was engaged, and there consequently flowed into his coffers - and some say into those of the government also - considerable sums of money. </span>
      <span id="f03381">It is indeed a lamentable fact that the principal revenue of the Hawaiian government is derived from the fines levied upon, or rather the licences taken out by Vice, the prosperity of which is linked with that of the government. </span>
      <span id="f03382">Were the people to become virtuous the authorities would become poor; but from present indications there is little apprehension to be entertained on that score.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f03383">Some five months after the date of the cession, the Dublin frigate, carrying the flag of Rear-Admiral Thomas, entered the harbour of Honolulu. </span>
      <span id="f03384">The excitement that her sudden appearance produced on shore was prodigious. </span>
      <span id="f03385">Three days after her arrival an English sailor hauled down the red cross which had been flying from the heights of the fort, and the Hawaiian colours were again displayed upon the same staff. </span>
      <span id="f03386">At the same moment the long 42-pounders upon Punchbowl Hill opened their iron throats in triumphant reply to the thunders of the five men-of-war in the harbour; and King Kammahammaha III, surrounded by a splendid group of British and American officers, unfurled the royal standard to assembled thousands of his subjects, who, attracted by the imposing military display of the foreigners, had flocked to witness the formal restoration of the islands to their ancient rulers.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f03387">The admiral, after sanctioning the proceedings of his subaltern, had brought the authorities to terms; and so removed the necessity of acting any longer under the provisional cession.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f03388">The event was made an occasion of riotous rejoicing by the king and the principal chiefs, who easily secured a display of enthusiasm from the inferior orders, by remitting for a time the accustomed severity of the laws. </span>
      <span id="f03389">Royal proclamations in English and Hawaiian were placarded in the streets of Honolulu, and posted up in the more populous villages of the group, in which His Majesty announced to his loving subjects the re-establishment of his throne, and called upon them to celebrate it by breaking through all moral, legal, and religious restraint for ten consecutive days, during which time all the laws of the land were solemnly declared to be suspended.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f03390">Who that happened to be at Honolulu during those ten memorable days will ever forget them! </span>
      <span id="f03391">The spectacle of universal broad-day debauchery, which was then exhibited, beggars description. </span>
      <span id="f03392">The natives of the surrounding islands flocked to Honolulu by hundreds, and the crews of two frigates, opportunely let loose like so many demons to swell the heathenish uproar, gave the crowning flourish to the scene. </span>
      <span id="f03393">It was a sort of Polynesian saturnalia. </span>
      <span id="f03394">Deeds too atrocious to be mentioned were done at noon-day in the open street, and some of the islanders, caught in the very act of stealing from the foreigners, were, on being taken to the fort by the aggrieved party, suffered immediately to go at large and to retain the stolen property - Kekuanoa informing the white men, with a sardonic grin, that the laws were &#34;hannapa&#34; (tied up).</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f03395">The history of these ten days reveals in their true colours the character of the Sandwich islanders, and furnishes an eloquent commentary on the results which have flowed from the labours of the missionaries. </span>
      <span id="f03396">Freed from the restraint of severe penal laws, the natives almost to a man had plunged voluntarily into every species of wickedness and excess, and by their utter disregard of all decency plainly showed that, although they had been schooled into a seeming submission to the new order of things, they were in reality as depraved and vicious as ever.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f03397">Such were the events which produced in America so general an outbreak of indignation against the spirited and high-minded Paulet. </span>
      <span id="f03398">He is not the first man who, in the fearless discharge of his duty, has awakened the senseless clamours of those whose narrow-minded suspicions blind them to a proper appreciation of measures which unusual exigencies may have rendered necessary.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f03399">It is almost needless to add that the British cabinet never had any idea of appropriating the islands; and it furnishes a sufficient vindication of the acts of Lord George Paulet, that he not only received the unqualified approbation of his own government, but that to this hour the great body of the Hawaiian people invoke blessings on his head, and look back with gratitude to the time when his liberal and paternal sway diffused peace and happiness among them.</span>
