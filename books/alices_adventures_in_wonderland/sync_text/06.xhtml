      <h2 id="f0475">CHAPTER VI. Pig and Pepper</h2>
      <p>
      <span id="f0477">For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood—(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. </span>
      <span id="f0478">It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads. </span>
      <span id="f0479">She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0480">The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, “For the Duchess. </span>
      <span id="f0481">An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.” The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the words a little, “From the Queen. </span>
      <span id="f0482">An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0483">Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0484">Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0485">Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0486">“There’s no sort of use in knocking,” said the Footman, “and that for two reasons. </span>
      <span id="f0487">First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.” And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary noise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0488">“Please, then,” said Alice, “how am I to get in?”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0489">“There might be some sense in your knocking,” the Footman went on without attending to her, “if we had the door between us. </span>
      <span id="f0490">For instance, if you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.” He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. </span>
      <span id="f0491">“But perhaps he can’t help it,” she said to herself; “his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his head. </span>
      <span id="f0492">But at any rate he might answer questions.—How am I to get in?” she repeated, aloud.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0493">“I shall sit here,” the Footman remarked, “till tomorrow—”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0494">At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came skimming out, straight at the Footman’s head: it just grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0495">“—or next day, maybe,” the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly as if nothing had happened.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0496">“How am I to get in?” asked Alice again, in a louder tone.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0497">“_Are_ you to get in at all?” said the Footman. </span>
      <span id="f0498">“That’s the first question, you know.”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0499">It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. </span>
      <span id="f0500">“It’s really dreadful,” she muttered to herself, “the way all the creatures argue. </span>
      <span id="f0501">It’s enough to drive one crazy!”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0502">The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark, with variations. </span>
      <span id="f0503">“I shall sit here,” he said, “on and off, for days and days.”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0504">“But what am _I_ to do?” said Alice.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0505">“Anything you like,” said the Footman, and began whistling.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0506">“Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said Alice desperately: “he’s perfectly idiotic!” And she opened the door and went in.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0507">The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0508">“There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0509">There was certainly too much of it in the air. </span>
      <span id="f0510">Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment’s pause. </span>
      <span id="f0511">The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0512">“Please would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, “why your cat grins like that?”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0513">“It’s a Cheshire cat,” said the Duchess, “and that’s why. </span>
      <span id="f0514">Pig!”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0515">She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:—</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0516">“I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t know that cats _could_ grin.”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0517">“They all can,” said the Duchess; “and most of ’em do.”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0518">“I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said very politely, feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0519">“You don’t know much,” said the Duchess; “and that’s a fact.”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0520">Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. </span>
      <span id="f0521">While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. </span>
      <span id="f0522">The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0523">“Oh, _please_ mind what you’re doing!” cried Alice, jumping up and down in an agony of terror. </span>
      <span id="f0524">“Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose!” as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0525">“If everybody minded their own business,” the Duchess said in a hoarse growl, “the world would go round a deal faster than it does.”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0526">“Which would _not_ be an advantage,” said Alice, who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. </span>
      <span id="f0527">“Just think of what work it would make with the day and night! </span>
      <span id="f0528">You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0529">“Talking of axes,” said the Duchess, “chop off her head!”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0530">Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: “Twenty-four hours, I _think_; or is it twelve? </span>
      <span id="f0531">I—”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0532">“Oh, don’t bother _me_,” said the Duchess; “I never could abide figures!” And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line:</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0533">“Speak roughly to your little boy,     And beat him when he sneezes: He only does it to annoy,     Because he knows it teases.”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0534">CHORUS. </span>
      <span id="f0535">(In which the cook and the baby joined):</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0536">“Wow! </span>
      <span id="f0537">wow! </span>
      <span id="f0538">wow!”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0539">While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:—</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0540">“I speak severely to my boy,     I beat him when he sneezes; For he can thoroughly enjoy     The pepper when he pleases!”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0541">CHORUS.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0542">“Wow! </span>
      <span id="f0543">wow! </span>
      <span id="f0544">wow!”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0545">“Here! </span>
      <span id="f0546">you may nurse it a bit, if you like!” the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. </span>
      <span id="f0547">“I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,” and she hurried out of the room. </span>
      <span id="f0548">The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0549">Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, “just like a star-fish,” thought Alice. </span>
      <span id="f0550">The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0551">As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air. </span>
      <span id="f0552">“If I don’t take this child away with me,” thought Alice, “they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be murder to leave it behind?” She said the last words out loud, and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time). </span>
      <span id="f0553">“Don’t grunt,” said Alice; “that’s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself.”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0554">The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it. </span>
      <span id="f0555">There could be no doubt that it had a _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all. </span>
      <span id="f0556">“But perhaps it was only sobbing,” she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0557">No, there were no tears. </span>
      <span id="f0558">“If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear,” said Alice, seriously, “I’ll have nothing more to do with you. </span>
      <span id="f0559">Mind now!” The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0560">Alice was just beginning to think to herself, “Now, what am I to do with this creature when I get it home?” when it grunted again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. </span>
      <span id="f0561">This time there could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0562">So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood. </span>
      <span id="f0563">“If it had grown up,” she said to herself, “it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.” And she began thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying to herself, “if one only knew the right way to change them—” when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0564">The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. </span>
      <span id="f0565">It looked good-natured, she thought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0566">“Cheshire Puss,” she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider. </span>
      <span id="f0567">“Come, it’s pleased so far,” thought Alice, and she went on. </span>
      <span id="f0568">“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0569">“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0570">“I don’t much care where—” said Alice.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0571">“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0572">“—so long as I get _somewhere_,” Alice added as an explanation.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0573">“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long enough.”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0574">Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question. </span>
      <span id="f0575">“What sort of people live about here?”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0576">“In _that_ direction,” the Cat said, waving its right paw round, “lives a Hatter: and in _that_ direction,” waving the other paw, “lives a March Hare. </span>
      <span id="f0577">Visit either you like: they’re both mad.”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0578">“But I don’t want to go among mad people,” Alice remarked.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0579">“Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “we’re all mad here. </span>
      <span id="f0580">I’m mad. </span>
      <span id="f0581">You’re mad.”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0582">“How do you know I’m mad?” said Alice.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0583">“You must be,” said the Cat, “or you wouldn’t have come here.”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0584">Alice didn’t think that proved it at all; however, she went on “And how do you know that you’re mad?”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0585">“To begin with,” said the Cat, “a dog’s not mad. </span>
      <span id="f0586">You grant that?”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0587">“I suppose so,” said Alice.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0588">“Well, then,” the Cat went on, “you see, a dog growls when it’s angry, and wags its tail when it’s pleased. </span>
      <span id="f0589">Now _I_ growl when I’m pleased, and wag my tail when I’m angry. </span>
      <span id="f0590">Therefore I’m mad.”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0591">“_I_ call it purring, not growling,” said Alice.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0592">“Call it what you like,” said the Cat. </span>
      <span id="f0593">“Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0594">“I should like it very much,” said Alice, “but I haven’t been invited yet.”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0595">“You’ll see me there,” said the Cat, and vanished.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0596">Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer things happening. </span>
      <span id="f0597">While she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0598">“By-the-bye, what became of the baby?” said the Cat. </span>
      <span id="f0599">“I’d nearly forgotten to ask.”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0600">“It turned into a pig,” Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back in a natural way.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0601">“I thought it would,” said the Cat, and vanished again.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0602">Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live. </span>
      <span id="f0603">“I’ve seen hatters before,” she said to herself; “the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won’t be raving mad—at least not so mad as it was in March.” As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0604">“Did you say pig, or fig?” said the Cat.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0605">“I said pig,” replied Alice; “and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0606">“All right,” said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0607">“Well! </span>
      <span id="f0608">I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice; “but a grin without a cat! </span>
      <span id="f0609">It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f0610">She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. </span>
      <span id="f0611">It was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself “Suppose it should be raving mad after all! </span>
      <span id="f0612">I almost wish I’d gone to see the Hatter instead!”</span>
      </p>
