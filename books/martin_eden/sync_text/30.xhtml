      <h2 id="f5598">CHAPTER XXX</h2>
      <p>
      <span id="f5599">On a beautiful fall day, a day of similar Indian summer to that which had seen their love declared the year before, Martin read his &#34;Love-cycle&#34; to Ruth. </span>
      <span id="f5600"> It was in the afternoon, and, as before, they had ridden out to their favorite knoll in the hills. </span>
      <span id="f5601"> Now and again she had interrupted his reading with exclamations of pleasure, and now, as he laid the last sheet of manuscript with its fellows, he waited her judgment.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5602">She delayed to speak, and at last she spoke haltingly, hesitating to frame in words the harshness of her thought.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5603">&#34;I think they are beautiful, very beautiful,&#34; she said; &#34;but you can&#39;t sell them, can you? </span>
      <span id="f5604"> You see what I mean,&#34; she said, almost pleaded. </span>
      <span id="f5605">&#34;This writing of yours is not practical. </span>
      <span id="f5606"> Something is the matter--maybe it is with the market--that prevents you from earning a living by it. </span>
      <span id="f5607"> And please, dear, don&#39;t misunderstand me. </span>
      <span id="f5608"> I am flattered, and made proud, and all that--I could not be a true woman were it otherwise--that you should write these poems to me. </span>
      <span id="f5609"> But they do not make our marriage possible. </span>
      <span id="f5610"> Don&#39;t you see, Martin? </span>
      <span id="f5611"> Don&#39;t think me mercenary. </span>
      <span id="f5612"> It is love, the thought of our future, with which I am burdened. </span>
      <span id="f5613"> A whole year has gone by since we learned we loved each other, and our wedding day is no nearer. </span>
      <span id="f5614"> Don&#39;t think me immodest in thus talking about our wedding, for really I have my heart, all that I am, at stake. </span>
      <span id="f5615"> Why don&#39;t you try to get work on a newspaper, if you are so bound up in your writing? </span>
      <span id="f5616"> Why not become a reporter?--for a while, at least?&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5617">&#34;It would spoil my style,&#34; was his answer, in a low, monotonous voice. </span>
      <span id="f5618">&#34;You have no idea how I&#39;ve worked for style.&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5619">&#34;But those storiettes,&#34; she argued. </span>
      <span id="f5620"> &#34;You called them hack-work. </span>
      <span id="f5621"> You wrote many of them. </span>
      <span id="f5622"> Didn&#39;t they spoil your style?&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5623">&#34;No, the cases are different. </span>
      <span id="f5624"> The storiettes were ground out, jaded, at the end of a long day of application to style. </span>
      <span id="f5625"> But a reporter&#39;s work is all hack from morning till night, is the one paramount thing of life. </span>
      <span id="f5626"> And it is a whirlwind life, the life of the moment, with neither past nor future, and certainly without thought of any style but reportorial style, and that certainly is not literature. </span>
      <span id="f5627"> To become a reporter now, just as my style is taking form, crystallizing, would be to commit literary suicide. </span>
      <span id="f5628"> As it is, every storiette, every word of every storiette, was a violation of myself, of my self-respect, of my respect for beauty. </span>
      <span id="f5629"> I tell you it was sickening. </span>
      <span id="f5630"> I was guilty of sin. </span>
      <span id="f5631"> And I was secretly glad when the markets failed, even if my clothes did go into pawn. </span>
      <span id="f5632"> But the joy of writing the &#39;Love-cycle&#39;! </span>
      <span id="f5633"> The creative joy in its noblest form! </span>
      <span id="f5634">That was compensation for everything.&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5635">Martin did not know that Ruth was unsympathetic concerning the creative joy. </span>
      <span id="f5636"> She used the phrase--it was on her lips he had first heard it. </span>
      <span id="f5637"> She had read about it, studied about it, in the university in the course of earning her Bachelorship of Arts; but she was not original, not creative, and all manifestations of culture on her part were but harpings of the harpings of others.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5638">&#34;May not the editor have been right in his revision of your &#39;Sea Lyrics&#39;?&#34; she questioned. </span>
      <span id="f5639"> &#34;Remember, an editor must have proved qualifications or else he would not be an editor.&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5640">&#34;That&#39;s in line with the persistence of the established,&#34; he rejoined, his heat against the editor-folk getting the better of him. </span>
      <span id="f5641"> &#34;What is, is not only right, but is the best possible. </span>
      <span id="f5642"> The existence of anything is sufficient vindication of its fitness to exist--to exist, mark you, as the average person unconsciously believes, not merely in present conditions, but in all conditions. </span>
      <span id="f5643"> It is their ignorance, of course, that makes them believe such rot--their ignorance, which is nothing more nor less than the henidical mental process described by Weininger. </span>
      <span id="f5644"> They think they think, and such thinkless creatures are the arbiters of the lives of the few who really think.&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5645">He paused, overcome by the consciousness that he had been talking over Ruth&#39;s head.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5646">&#34;I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t know who this Weininger is,&#34; she retorted. </span>
      <span id="f5647"> &#34;And you are so dreadfully general that I fail to follow you. </span>
      <span id="f5648"> What I was speaking of was the qualification of editors--&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5649">&#34;And I&#39;ll tell you,&#34; he interrupted. </span>
      <span id="f5650"> &#34;The chief qualification of ninety- nine per cent of all editors is failure. </span>
      <span id="f5651"> They have failed as writers. </span>
      <span id="f5652">Don&#39;t think they prefer the drudgery of the desk and the slavery to their circulation and to the business manager to the joy of writing. </span>
      <span id="f5653"> They have tried to write, and they have failed. </span>
      <span id="f5654"> And right there is the cursed paradox of it. </span>
      <span id="f5655"> Every portal to success in literature is guarded by those watch-dogs, the failures in literature. </span>
      <span id="f5656"> The editors, sub-editors, associate editors, most of them, and the manuscript-readers for the magazines and book-publishers, most of them, nearly all of them, are men who wanted to write and who have failed. </span>
      <span id="f5657"> And yet they, of all creatures under the sun the most unfit, are the very creatures who decide what shall and what shall not find its way into print--they, who have proved themselves not original, who have demonstrated that they lack the divine fire, sit in judgment upon originality and genius. </span>
      <span id="f5658"> And after them come the reviewers, just so many more failures. </span>
      <span id="f5659"> Don&#39;t tell me that they have not dreamed the dream and attempted to write poetry or fiction; for they have, and they have failed. </span>
      <span id="f5660"> Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod-liver oil. </span>
      <span id="f5661"> But you know my opinion on the reviewers and the alleged critics. </span>
      <span id="f5662"> There are great critics, but they are as rare as comets. </span>
      <span id="f5663"> If I fail as a writer, I shall have proved for the career of editorship. </span>
      <span id="f5664"> There&#39;s bread and butter and jam, at any rate.&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5665">Ruth&#39;s mind was quick, and her disapproval of her lover&#39;s views was buttressed by the contradiction she found in his contention.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5666">&#34;But, Martin, if that be so, if all the doors are closed as you have shown so conclusively, how is it possible that any of the great writers ever arrived?&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5667">&#34;They arrived by achieving the impossible,&#34; he answered. </span>
      <span id="f5668"> &#34;They did such blazing, glorious work as to burn to ashes those that opposed them. </span>
      <span id="f5669"> They arrived by course of miracle, by winning a thousand-to-one wager against them. </span>
      <span id="f5670"> They arrived because they were Carlyle&#39;s battle-scarred giants who will not be kept down. </span>
      <span id="f5671"> And that is what I must do; I must achieve the impossible.&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5672">&#34;But if you fail? </span>
      <span id="f5673"> You must consider me as well, Martin.&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5674">&#34;If I fail?&#34;  He regarded her for a moment as though the thought she had uttered was unthinkable. </span>
      <span id="f5675"> Then intelligence illumined his eyes. </span>
      <span id="f5676"> &#34;If I fail, I shall become an editor, and you will be an editor&#39;s wife.&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5677">She frowned at his facetiousness--a pretty, adorable frown that made him put his arm around her and kiss it away.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5678">&#34;There, that&#39;s enough,&#34; she urged, by an effort of will withdrawing herself from the fascination of his strength. </span>
      <span id="f5679"> &#34;I have talked with father and mother. </span>
      <span id="f5680"> I never before asserted myself so against them. </span>
      <span id="f5681"> I demanded to be heard. </span>
      <span id="f5682"> I was very undutiful. </span>
      <span id="f5683"> They are against you, you know; but I assured them over and over of my abiding love for you, and at last father agreed that if you wanted to, you could begin right away in his office. </span>
      <span id="f5684"> And then, of his own accord, he said he would pay you enough at the start so that we could get married and have a little cottage somewhere. </span>
      <span id="f5685"> Which I think was very fine of him--don&#39;t you?&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5686">Martin, with the dull pain of despair at his heart, mechanically reaching for the tobacco and paper (which he no longer carried) to roll a cigarette, muttered something inarticulate, and Ruth went on.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5687">&#34;Frankly, though, and don&#39;t let it hurt you--I tell you, to show you precisely how you stand with him--he doesn&#39;t like your radical views, and he thinks you are lazy. </span>
      <span id="f5688"> Of course I know you are not. </span>
      <span id="f5689"> I know you work hard.&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5690">How hard, even she did not know, was the thought in Martin&#39;s mind.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5691">&#34;Well, then,&#34; he said, &#34;how about my views? </span>
      <span id="f5692"> Do you think they are so radical?&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5693">He held her eyes and waited the answer.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5694">&#34;I think them, well, very disconcerting,&#34; she replied.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5695">The question was answered for him, and so oppressed was he by the grayness of life that he forgot the tentative proposition she had made for him to go to work. </span>
      <span id="f5696"> And she, having gone as far as she dared, was willing to wait the answer till she should bring the question up again.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5697">She had not long to wait. </span>
      <span id="f5698"> Martin had a question of his own to propound to her. </span>
      <span id="f5699"> He wanted to ascertain the measure of her faith in him, and within the week each was answered. </span>
      <span id="f5700"> Martin precipitated it by reading to her his &#34;The Shame of the Sun.&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5701">&#34;Why don&#39;t you become a reporter?&#34; she asked when he had finished. </span>
      <span id="f5702"> &#34;You love writing so, and I am sure you would succeed. </span>
      <span id="f5703"> You could rise in journalism and make a name for yourself. </span>
      <span id="f5704"> There are a number of great special correspondents. </span>
      <span id="f5705"> Their salaries are large, and their field is the world. </span>
      <span id="f5706"> They are sent everywhere, to the heart of Africa, like Stanley, or to interview the Pope, or to explore unknown Thibet.&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5707">&#34;Then you don&#39;t like my essay?&#34; he rejoined. </span>
      <span id="f5708"> &#34;You believe that I have some show in journalism but none in literature?&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5709">&#34;No, no; I do like it. </span>
      <span id="f5710"> It reads well. </span>
      <span id="f5711"> But I am afraid it&#39;s over the heads of your readers. </span>
      <span id="f5712"> At least it is over mine. </span>
      <span id="f5713"> It sounds beautiful, but I don&#39;t understand it. </span>
      <span id="f5714"> Your scientific slang is beyond me. </span>
      <span id="f5715"> You are an extremist, you know, dear, and what may be intelligible to you may not be intelligible to the rest of us.&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5716">&#34;I imagine it&#39;s the philosophic slang that bothers you,&#34; was all he could say.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5717">He was flaming from the fresh reading of the ripest thought he had expressed, and her verdict stunned him.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5718">&#34;No matter how poorly it is done,&#34; he persisted, &#34;don&#39;t you see anything in it?--in the thought of it, I mean?&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5719">She shook her head.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5720">&#34;No, it is so different from anything I have read. </span>
      <span id="f5721"> I read Maeterlinck and understand him--&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5722">&#34;His mysticism, you understand that?&#34; Martin flashed out.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5723">&#34;Yes, but this of yours, which is supposed to be an attack upon him, I don&#39;t understand. </span>
      <span id="f5724"> Of course, if originality counts--&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5725">He stopped her with an impatient gesture that was not followed by speech. </span>
      <span id="f5726">He became suddenly aware that she was speaking and that she had been speaking for some time.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5727">&#34;After all, your writing has been a toy to you,&#34; she was saying. </span>
      <span id="f5728"> &#34;Surely you have played with it long enough. </span>
      <span id="f5729"> It is time to take up life seriously--_our_ life, Martin. </span>
      <span id="f5730"> Hitherto you have lived solely your own.&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5731">&#34;You want me to go to work?&#34; he asked.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5732">&#34;Yes. </span>
      <span id="f5733"> Father has offered--&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5734">&#34;I understand all that,&#34; he broke in; &#34;but what I want to know is whether or not you have lost faith in me?&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5735">She pressed his hand mutely, her eyes dim.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5736">&#34;In your writing, dear,&#34; she admitted in a half-whisper.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5737">&#34;You&#39;ve read lots of my stuff,&#34; he went on brutally. </span>
      <span id="f5738"> &#34;What do you think of it? </span>
      <span id="f5739"> Is it utterly hopeless? </span>
      <span id="f5740"> How does it compare with other men&#39;s work?&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5741">&#34;But they sell theirs, and you--don&#39;t.&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5742">&#34;That doesn&#39;t answer my question. </span>
      <span id="f5743"> Do you think that literature is not at all my vocation?&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5744">&#34;Then I will answer.&#34;  She steeled herself to do it. </span>
      <span id="f5745"> &#34;I don&#39;t think you were made to write. </span>
      <span id="f5746"> Forgive me, dear. </span>
      <span id="f5747"> You compel me to say it; and you know I know more about literature than you do.&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5748">&#34;Yes, you are a Bachelor of Arts,&#34; he said meditatively; &#34;and you ought to know.&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5749">&#34;But there is more to be said,&#34; he continued, after a pause painful to both. </span>
      <span id="f5750"> &#34;I know what I have in me. </span>
      <span id="f5751"> No one knows that so well as I. </span>
      <span id="f5752"> I know I shall succeed. </span>
      <span id="f5753"> I will not be kept down. </span>
      <span id="f5754"> I am afire with what I have to say in verse, and fiction, and essay. </span>
      <span id="f5755"> I do not ask you to have faith in that, though. </span>
      <span id="f5756"> I do not ask you to have faith in me, nor in my writing. </span>
      <span id="f5757"> What I do ask of you is to love me and have faith in love.&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5758">&#34;A year ago I believed for two years. </span>
      <span id="f5759"> One of those years is yet to run. </span>
      <span id="f5760">And I do believe, upon my honor and my soul, that before that year is run I shall have succeeded. </span>
      <span id="f5761"> You remember what you told me long ago, that I must serve my apprenticeship to writing. </span>
      <span id="f5762"> Well, I have served it. </span>
      <span id="f5763"> I have crammed it and telescoped it. </span>
      <span id="f5764"> With you at the end awaiting me, I have never shirked. </span>
      <span id="f5765"> Do you know, I have forgotten what it is to fall peacefully asleep. </span>
      <span id="f5766"> A few million years ago I knew what it was to sleep my fill and to awake naturally from very glut of sleep. </span>
      <span id="f5767"> I am awakened always now by an alarm clock. </span>
      <span id="f5768"> If I fall asleep early or late, I set the alarm accordingly; and this, and the putting out of the lamp, are my last conscious actions.&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5769">&#34;When I begin to feel drowsy, I change the heavy book I am reading for a lighter one. </span>
      <span id="f5770"> And when I doze over that, I beat my head with my knuckles in order to drive sleep away. </span>
      <span id="f5771"> Somewhere I read of a man who was afraid to sleep. </span>
      <span id="f5772"> Kipling wrote the story. </span>
      <span id="f5773"> This man arranged a spur so that when unconsciousness came, his naked body pressed against the iron teeth. </span>
      <span id="f5774">Well, I&#39;ve done the same. </span>
      <span id="f5775"> I look at the time, and I resolve that not until midnight, or not until one o&#39;clock, or two o&#39;clock, or three o&#39;clock, shall the spur be removed. </span>
      <span id="f5776"> And so it rowels me awake until the appointed time. </span>
      <span id="f5777"> That spur has been my bed-mate for months. </span>
      <span id="f5778"> I have grown so desperate that five and a half hours of sleep is an extravagance. </span>
      <span id="f5779"> I sleep four hours now. </span>
      <span id="f5780"> I am starved for sleep. </span>
      <span id="f5781"> There are times when I am light-headed from want of sleep, times when death, with its rest and sleep, is a positive lure to me, times when I am haunted by Longfellow&#39;s lines:</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5782">&#34;&#39;The sea is still and deep;    All things within its bosom sleep;    A single step and all is o&#39;er,    A plunge, a bubble, and no more.&#39;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5783">&#34;Of course, this is sheer nonsense. </span>
      <span id="f5784"> It comes from nervousness, from an overwrought mind. </span>
      <span id="f5785"> But the point is: Why have I done this? </span>
      <span id="f5786"> For you. </span>
      <span id="f5787"> To shorten my apprenticeship. </span>
      <span id="f5788"> To compel Success to hasten. </span>
      <span id="f5789"> And my apprenticeship is now served. </span>
      <span id="f5790"> I know my equipment. </span>
      <span id="f5791"> I swear that I learn more each month than the average college man learns in a year. </span>
      <span id="f5792"> I know it, I tell you. </span>
      <span id="f5793"> But were my need for you to understand not so desperate I should not tell you. </span>
      <span id="f5794"> It is not boasting. </span>
      <span id="f5795"> I measure the results by the books. </span>
      <span id="f5796"> Your brothers, to-day, are ignorant barbarians compared with me and the knowledge I have wrung from the books in the hours they were sleeping. </span>
      <span id="f5797"> Long ago I wanted to be famous. </span>
      <span id="f5798"> I care very little for fame now. </span>
      <span id="f5799"> What I want is you; I am more hungry for you than for food, or clothing, or recognition. </span>
      <span id="f5800"> I have a dream of laying my head on your breast and sleeping an aeon or so, and the dream will come true ere another year is gone.&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5801">His power beat against her, wave upon wave; and in the moment his will opposed hers most she felt herself most strongly drawn toward him. </span>
      <span id="f5802"> The strength that had always poured out from him to her was now flowering in his impassioned voice, his flashing eyes, and the vigor of life and intellect surging in him. </span>
      <span id="f5803"> And in that moment, and for the moment, she was aware of a rift that showed in her certitude--a rift through which she caught sight of the real Martin Eden, splendid and invincible; and as animal-trainers have their moments of doubt, so she, for the instant, seemed to doubt her power to tame this wild spirit of a man.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5804">&#34;And another thing,&#34; he swept on. </span>
      <span id="f5805"> &#34;You love me. </span>
      <span id="f5806"> But why do you love me? </span>
      <span id="f5807">The thing in me that compels me to write is the very thing that draws your love. </span>
      <span id="f5808"> You love me because I am somehow different from the men you have known and might have loved. </span>
      <span id="f5809"> I was not made for the desk and counting-house, for petty business squabbling, and legal jangling. </span>
      <span id="f5810"> Make me do such things, make me like those other men, doing the work they do, breathing the air they breathe, developing the point of view they have developed, and you have destroyed the difference, destroyed me, destroyed the thing you love. </span>
      <span id="f5811"> My desire to write is the most vital thing in me. </span>
      <span id="f5812">Had I been a mere clod, neither would I have desired to write, nor would you have desired me for a husband.&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5813">&#34;But you forget,&#34; she interrupted, the quick surface of her mind glimpsing a parallel. </span>
      <span id="f5814"> &#34;There have been eccentric inventors, starving their families while they sought such chimeras as perpetual motion. </span>
      <span id="f5815">Doubtless their wives loved them, and suffered with them and for them, not because of but in spite of their infatuation for perpetual motion.&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5816">&#34;True,&#34; was the reply. </span>
      <span id="f5817"> &#34;But there have been inventors who were not eccentric and who starved while they sought to invent practical things; and sometimes, it is recorded, they succeeded. </span>
      <span id="f5818"> Certainly I do not seek any impossibilities--&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5819">&#34;You have called it &#39;achieving the impossible,&#39;&#34; she interpolated.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5820">&#34;I spoke figuratively. </span>
      <span id="f5821"> I seek to do what men have done before me--to write and to live by my writing.&#34;</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5822">Her silence spurred him on.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5823">&#34;To you, then, my goal is as much a chimera as perpetual motion?&#34; he demanded.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5824">He read her answer in the pressure of her hand on his--the pitying mother- hand for the hurt child. </span>
      <span id="f5825"> And to her, just then, he was the hurt child, the infatuated man striving to achieve the impossible.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5826">Toward the close of their talk she warned him again of the antagonism of her father and mother.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5827">&#34;But you love me?&#34; he asked.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5828">&#34;I do! </span>
      <span id="f5829"> I do!&#34; she cried.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      <span id="f5830">&#34;And I love you, not them, and nothing they do can hurt me.&#34;  Triumph sounded in his voice. </span>
      <span id="f5831"> &#34;For I have faith in your love, not fear of their enmity. </span>
      <span id="f5832"> All things may go astray in this world, but not love. </span>
      <span id="f5833"> Love cannot go wrong unless it be a weakling that faints and stumbles by the way.&#34;</span>
